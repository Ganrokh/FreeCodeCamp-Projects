# FreeCodeCamp-Projects
Projects for the FreeCodeCamp certifications.
FreeCodeCamp (FCC) progress was started in 2018. I made it partway through the React section before deciding that a more in-depth course on React would be more effective.
I will be coming back to complete FCC eventually, likely beginning with their new Python projects.
